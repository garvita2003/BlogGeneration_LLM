# BlogGeneration_LLM

End To End LLM Project Using LLAMA 2 - Blog Generation LLM project
1. Create model folder and download Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML using https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML/blob/main/llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin and keep inside that folder
2. Llama 2 Model : Designed to generate text and assist in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
3. Hugging face model: These models are pre-trained on large datasets and are designed for a variety of natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and audio tasks. Hugging Face is widely used because it simplifies the development, deployment, and experimentation with machine learning models.
